# finalProject
Chaitanya's and Seth's final project for APCSA. There are 2 folders. They have the exact same code but one is for a BlueJ project and the other is for a VSCode project.

Directions:

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move around. Collect the red apples and avoid the white obstacles. The game will end once you hit yourself, a wall, or an obstacle.
